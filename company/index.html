            <p>The T-35, also know as a Radiant Control toaster is considered
              by many to be the best toaster ever made. While the 
              T-35 is lacking in its aesthetic appeal, it 
              is a durable and functional toaster. Although it was introduced over 
              seven decades ago, the T-35, with proper care, 
              can be used as your everyday toaster.

            <p>Sunbeam toasters from the late 1950's and 1960's are 
              handsome, functional, affordable vintage toasters. They offer 
              more features a modern user would expect in comparison to the 
              utilitarian designs of the 1940's and early 1950's.
